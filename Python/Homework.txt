Bangladesh weather dataset: temp_and_rain.csv
● Siddhika is analyzing the weather of Bangladesh using a weather dataset. The dataset contains four columns:
● temp ( Temperature )
● Month
● Year
● rain
● Help Siddhika in checking whether the dataset contains any missing values or not. If it contains any missing
values then help her in dealing with the missing values.
● Siddhika didn't want any null value in the dataset. So she decided to fill 0 at the place of all null values. Write a
program for the same.
● Siddhika filled all the null values with 0. But then her friend Monika told her how putting 0 at the place of null
values is making the dataset inaccurate.
● Example: If in the 6th month the temperature is 27 then it can not suddenly drop to 0 in the next month.
● So Monika suggested Siddhika, fill the missing value with the value of the previous month. In this case, data will
be more accurate. Help Siddhika in doing the same thing.
